# Family Feud Game

### <em>Video Walkthrough: </em>https://youtu.be/9rT6Zetc9zM


## Description:

This is a Family Feud Game built in Powerpoint that is perfect for team-building meetings at work, with family, or with friends.  It’s particularly well suited for playing over video chat platforms like Zoom or Skype.

I have played and hosted this game at work during several team meetings, and it’s a good way to add a little fun.

Please feel free to download the Powerpoint game labelled “Family Feud Game_populated” or “Family Feud Game_template”, along with the other supporting files. 
There are three files with banks of sample questions to use, “100 Family Feud Questions”, “Family Feud_Questions Master”, and “Family Feud_Questions Master 2”.  
The Excel file is a spreadsheet that can be used as a scorecard.  
The title screen image, and game board slide template image are also included in this repository. 

## Gameplay:

Please watch the video walkthrough (link above) for a step-by-step explanation of how to use the Powerpoint and play the game.
